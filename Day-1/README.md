/** Day 1 exercise 1.1 
## Printing to the Console

# Instructions

Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function. 

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

# Example Output

After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:

```
Day 1 - Python Print Function
```

```
The function is declared like this:
```

```
print('what to print')
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

 Day 1 exercise 1.2

## Debugging

# Instructions

Look at the code in the code editor on the left. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass. 

# Example Output

When you run your program, it should print the following:

```
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
